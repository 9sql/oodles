# Oodles


Oodles provides easy to use and easy to integrate solution for performance bench-marking.Oodles is based on Gatling framework.

  - Gatling is an opensource project that helps in performance benchmarking of an application (https://github.com/gatling/gatling).
  - New Simulations can be added using scala language.
  - It provides useful reports to measure performance for each simulation.

# New Features!

  - Integrated with spring-boot. Easy to run and easy to extend solution.
  - Added new parameters to specify source-folder(sf),simulation-name(s) and report-folder(rf).


You can also:
  - Write your simulation test cases in scala/simuations folder.
  - Running OodlesApplication will execute specified simulation using arguments named -s;
  - Extend boot application to accept http requests and execute simulations.

And of course Oodles itself is open source with a [public repository][Oodles]
 on GitHub.

### Todos

 - Accept http requests to execute simulations.
 - Add more configurations to support additional report parameters.
